### Install on macOS

2. Open the DMG file
3. Drag **FreeDroid** to your **Applications** folder

### ⚠️ First Launch (Important!)

Since FreeDroid is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate, macOS Gatekeeper will block it on first launch. This is normal for open-source apps.

**To open FreeDroid for the first time:**

1. Open **Applications** folder in Finder
2. **Right-click** (or Control-click) on **FreeDroid**
3. Click **"Open"** from the context menu
4. Click **"Open"** again in the dialog that appears

> **Note**: You only need to do this once! After the first launch, FreeDroid will open normally by double-clicking.

<summary>💡 Alternative method (Terminal)</summary>

If the right-click method doesn't work, run this command in Terminal:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/FreeDroid.app
```

Then double-click to launch normally.

- Try a different USB cable (some cables are charge-only)

### Transfer fails

- Make sure your Android device has enough storage space
- Check that the target folder is accessible on your device
- Try restarting both the app and your Android device

### Pull mode shows "No devices found"
